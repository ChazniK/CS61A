Lecture 1
--------------------
Expression: computation and evaluates to a value
Call expression add -> operator (2, 3) -> operand	(operators and operands are also expressions)
 
Lecture 2
--------------------
# Primitive expressions -> number(2), name(add), string('hello')
# Call expressions -> See lecture 1 notes 
# Environment -> Sequence of frames(Binding between names and values)
Name evaluates to value bound to name in earliest frame of current environment which name is found.
A function thats does not explicitly return a value will return none

Lecture 3
--------------------
Return statement - completes evaluation of call expression and provides its value

Functions domain is the set of all inputs it might take as arguements
Functions range is the set of all output values it might return


Lecture 4
-------------------
Higher Order Functions - function that takes another function as an arguement
